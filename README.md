# MRU Function

## Install
Install using Pathogen. Just clone this repo into your "bundle" directory.

## Usage 
- Press `<F3>` to open MRU Function Location window.
- Move cursor to line where function is and press `<Enter>` to go there.

## Todo/Issues
- Check if function exists/was moved
- Write better function to find which function the cursor is in for Python.  Current function is naive and a stand-in to see if an MRU Function plugin is useful
- Include class name next to function location display in MRU Function Window.  If you have many \__init__'s or similar inherited function/object names it is hard to differentiate which one is which
- Update to work for js and other languages
